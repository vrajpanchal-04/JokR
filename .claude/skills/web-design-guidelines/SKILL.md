# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the guidelines from `guidelines.md` next to this file
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

The rules live in `guidelines.md` in this skill's folder (a pinned copy of
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md,
see SOURCE.md). Use the local copy so reviews are repeatable and work offline.
To refresh it, replace `guidelines.md` with the upstream file in a reviewed PR.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `guidelines.md`
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
